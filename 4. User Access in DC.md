### 3.2. System Administrator:

-Implement and configure the tools and solutions outlined in the SOP, including network file sharing, cloud storage, file synchronization, and VPNs.
-Ensure that appropriate access controls, authentication methods, and encryption techniques are in place to secure user files.
-Monitor file access logs and use SIEM tools to detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.
-Maintain the systems and tools used for file access and implement updates and patches as required.
-Provide training and support to end-users on accessing their files from any domain-attached system and ensuring they are aware of security best practices.

### 3.3. End-Users:

-Understand the SOP and how it relates to their job responsibilities.
-Ensure that they only access files they are authorized to access and adhere to the access controls and security measures outlined in the SOP.
-Use the tools and solutions provided in the SOP to access their files from any domain-attached system.
-Report any suspected unauthorized access attempts or security incidents to the appropriate personnel.

33 4.0 Prerequisites

> [Access to domain-attached systems and devices]
> [Administrative privileges to configure system settings]
> [Knowledge of file sharing and synchronization tools]
> [Understanding of access controls and security best practices]

## 5.0 Procedure

### 5.1. Evaluate Current Infrastructure

### 5.1.1. Conduct a thorough evaluation of the current infrastructure, including the network architecture, file server configurations, user permissions, and access controls.

### 5.1.2. Identify any potential security risks or vulnerabilities that may impact file access.

### 5.2. Implement Network File Sharing

### 5.2.1. Set up network file sharing to allow users to access their files from any domain-attached system.

### 5.2.2. Configure the file server to allow access from domain-attached systems, and implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access their files.

### 5.3. Implement Cloud Storage

### 5.3.1. Consider using cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive to store user files.

### 5.3.2. Ensure that appropriate access controls and encryption methods are in place to protect sensitive files.

### 5.4. Set Up File Synchronization

### 5.4.1. Implement file synchronization tools such as Microsoft OneDrive or Dropbox to sync user files across devices.

### 5.4.2. Ensure that the synchronization process is secure, and implement access controls to limit who can synchronize files.

### 5.5. Provide Secure Remote Access

### 5.5.1. Implement a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to allow users to securely access domain-attached systems from remote locations.

### 5.5.2. Ensure that the VPN is properly configured and secured, and that users are trained on how to use it safely.

### 5.6. Ensure Proper Access Controls

### 5.6.1 Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users have access to their files.

### 5.6.1 Use strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

### 5.7. Monitor File Access

### 5.7.1. Monitor file access logs to detect and investigate any unauthorized access attempts.

### 5.7.2. Use security information and event management (SIEM) tools to alert administrators to any suspicious activity.

### 5.8. Provide Training and Support

### 5.8.1. Provide training and support to users on how to access their files from any domain-attached system.
### 5.8.2. Ensure that users are aware of security best practices and know how to properly use the tools provided to them.
