> [The outline of the activities or sequence of steps for performing the procedure. This should not be overly detailed -- let it capture the shape of the activity to be performed, regardless of how the details of its implementation might change.]

- Begin with a flow chart map of the parts of the procedure being defined. This will become your outline
- Bundle closely related tasks together for concision, especially if they always occur together/in sequence without much deviation
- Work to have 5-7 tasks -- too few and it's not worth reading; too many and it's too hard to read. This is about parsing.
- Now revise the flowchart to match the way you have bundled steps and number each steps
- Write a concise, focused description for each step
- Add a brief opening overview paragraph to describe the topic , inputs, outputs, expected results, and involved roles
