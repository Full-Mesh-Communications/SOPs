# Network Change Management SOP:
_"How will you manage change to the network (such as hardware, software, or configuration changes) while minimizing network disruptions and downtime?"_


## Purpose:

This SOP defines the steps and standards to perform any changes to GreenGenius' network.

## Scope:

Network change management can affect external customers and company employees and business partners.

## Responsibilities:

**Paul Stroud** is responsible for implementing, following, reviewing, maintaining, and updating this policy.


## Prerequisites:

- Full Mesh is responsible for network design, configuration, and deployment. Full Mesh network technicians will process any network change requests.<br>
- GreenGenius CTO is to request network changes and to approve proposed solutions.<br>
- Full Mesh network technicians are to reference the network diagram and existing configurations when processing customer's change requests.<br>
> [The information, resources, permissions, etc. required to execute this procedure.]

## Procedure:

Network change management ensures that any modifications to the existing network infrastructure are designed and implemented in a controlled fashion, with the approval from the customer along the way. This ensures that any proposed solution will meet customer's need. Proper network change management also minimizes any impact on the end users and any other stakeholders.

Network Change Steps:
1. Customer submits change request
2. MSP technicians review change request and design a solution
3. Customer reviews the solution and approves/rejects
4. Customer proposes the maintenance window
5. MSP confirms/rejects the maintenance window
6. MSP implements changes
7. Customer verifies functionality


> [The outline of the activities or sequence of steps for performing the procedure. This should not be overly detailed -- let it capture the shape of the activity to be performed, regardless of how the details of its implementation might change.]

- Begin with a flow chart map of the parts of the procedure being defined. This will become your outline
- Bundle closely related tasks together for concision, especially if they always occur together/in sequence without much deviation
- Work to have 5-7 tasks -- too few and it's not worth reading; too many and it's too hard to read. This is about parsing.
- Now revise the flowchart to match the way you have bundled steps and number each steps
- Write a concise, focused description for each step
- Add a brief opening overview paragraph to describe the topic , inputs, outputs, expected results, and involved roles
