# Network Security SOP:

## Purpose:

This SOP defines the steps, standards, and procedures to secure GreenGenius' network.

## Scope:

Network security affects all internal and external stakeholders, including: customers, company employees, business partners, and vendors. Compliance with specific security frameworks may also be required by the applicable laws and regulations.

## Responsibilities:

**Paul Stroud** is responsible for implementing, following, reviewing, maintaining, and updating this policy.


## Prerequisites:

- Full Mesh is responsible for design, configuration, and deployment of GreenGenius' network.<br>
- GreenGenius CTO and CEO are to review and approve proposed solutions.<br>
- Full Mesh network technicians are to reference the network diagram, organizational chart, company policies, and existing configurations when implementing security controls and measures.<br>

## Procedure:

Network security deters, prevents, and inhibits unauthorized access to systems and data. Security controls include Technical, Administrative, and Physical measures taken to provide Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of customer's information. It is vital to communicate security standards to all users in order to ensure compliance. A single vulnerability could potentially compromise the entire network.

Network Security Standards:
1. Access-layer switches should be configured to: a. disable unused ports, and b. have port security set to "sticky" MAC addresses
2. All network infrastructure devices should be configured for secure admin access via SSH. Telnet access should be disabled on all devices.
3. Active Directory should implement the principle of least privilege and be periodically audited for privilege creep.
4. All account passwords must meet the password complexity requirements (10 characters minimum, a mix of capital and lowercase characters, and numbers and special characters).
5. All Windows endpoints should be scheduled to update daily, outside of business hours.
6. Windows Server should be updated over the weekend to ensure that the updates do not disrupt company network.
7. Any unused network ports/services should be disabled. This applies to all network devices, including Windows Server, Windows endpoints, and intermediary devices.
8. All switches and routers should be secured in locked cabinets to prevent tampering and unauthorized access.
9. All critical data is to be backed up daily.
